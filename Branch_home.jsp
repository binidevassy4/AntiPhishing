            <p>Technology has touched every aspect of our lives. Right from the moment we wake up to the moment we go back to bed at night, technology surrounds us. Be it shopping for groceries, paying utility bills, learning to play a new instrument, finding a plumber, getting food delivered or anything else for that matter, technology offers a solution for almost everything we could possibly imagine.

                Banking is definitely not a stranger to technology. Internet banking has made life simpler for millions and millions of people around the world. Especially in India, where a bank visit implies waiting in never-ending queues, online banking is definitely a blessing. Online banking has made it possible for customers to do simple tasks like accessing their savings account anytime, keep track of their account balance, get e-statements, pay bills online, shop online, transfer funds and much more in under a few clicks and within a matter of minutes.</p>

              <p>Online Banking, also known as net banking, e-banking or online banking, is the facility provided by banks and financial institutions which allows customers to use banking services via internet. There are scores of services like online money transfer, account opening, bill payment, tracking account activity, etc., which are made available to customers with the help of online banking. Online banking also allows banks to advertise their products and services in a manner that it reaches out millions of customers. However, in order to use online banking, an individual will require access to the internet, which is scarcely available in rural areas. Internet banking can also be accessed via mobile phones which have a data 3G/4G connection.</p>
